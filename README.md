# AI Imagery and Video Analysis Project

This project explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with imagery and video analysis, focusing on applications such as enhanced realism in computer-generated imagery (CGI), real-time video editing, deepfake detection, and extracting customer insights from visual data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.9
- OpenCV
- Media

#### Setup

1. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run Main**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Built With

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - The computer vision library used
- [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) - Framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines
- [Transforms3D](https://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/) - Python library for 3D coordinate transformations
